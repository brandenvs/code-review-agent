Hey, Donna.

Thank you for completing your task on user-defined functions in Python.

Your holiday cost calculator completes the task objectives by implementing the three user-defined functions(hotel_cost, plane_cost and car_rental). These functions are well documented and perform the necessary mapping and calculations based on the input parameters passed.


Improve
âŒ Code Correctness

When prompting the user for input, we should be mindful that a user may input inconsistent inputs that are not the expected input. Our applications should handle these inconsistencies by normalising the input before passing it to a function. For example, the program throws an exception if a user had to use your application and input Paris instead of the expected Paris. To resolve this, you will normalise your input function by calling.lower() at the end of city_flight input. This will always make the input case insensitive, and inside your plane_cost function, you would normalise the strings so that they are also only lowercase.

âš ï¸ Code Documentation

As much as I appreciate that you documented your code well, your docstrings for each function are misplaced. The correct position for these docstrings is directly after defining the function. 
For example, see the linked PEP 8 documentation - 
ðŸ”— https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/#:~:text=a%20separate%20line.-,For%20example%3A,-def%20complex(


Overall
Overall, you've implemented the task objectives and compiled a well-documented and structured Python script that determines the cost of a user's holiday based on their inputs. However, please kindly note the above improvements as these will benefit you when completing tasks in the future.

Well done, Donna, keep up the good work ðŸ‘.
