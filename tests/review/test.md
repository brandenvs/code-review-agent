Generated Review: **Review:**

**Efficiency:** Acceptable

The code is well-structured and easy to follow. The user-defined functions (car_rental, hotel_cost, and plane_cost) perform calculations based on the passed parameters efficiently.

**Positive aspects:**
* The code implements user-defined functions effectively.
* The application handles user input for city_glight normalization and nested numerical inputs with type integer.   

**Improve:**

To improve efficiency, consider adding error handling to prevent explicit errors when a string is inputted instead of an integer. You can surround your input functions with a try-except statement to achieve this. For example:       
```python
try:
    num_nights = int(input("Enter the number of nights: "))
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer.")
```
Additionally, consider using docstrings to document your user-defined functions effectively.

**Completeness:** Outstanding

The code successfully implements the task objectives instructed.

**Positive aspects:**
* The code implements all required functionality (hotel_cost, car_rental, and plane_cost).
* It handles user input for city_glight normalization and nested numerical inputs with type integer.

**Improve:**

None.

**Overall:** Excellent

Your holiday cost tracker is well-structured and easy to follow. The application handles user input for city_glight normalization and nested numerical inputs with type integer effectively. However, there is room for improvement in terms of error handling and code documentation.

**Code Documentation:** Needs Work

While you have used block comments, consider using docstrings to document your user-defined functions effectively. This will make it easier for others to understand the code.

**Style:** Acceptable

The code is well-structured and easy to follow. However, there are minor issues with formatting (e.g., inconsistent indentation).

**Positive aspects:**
* The code is well-organized.
* It uses consistent naming conventions.

**Improve:**

Consider following PEP 8 guidelines for code style and formatting.
