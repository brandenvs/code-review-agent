   * trainer = "Mr Anon A. Mouse"
* Create a method in the OOPCourse subclass named trainer_details that prints what the course is about and the name of the trainer by using the description and trainer attributes.
* Create a method in the OOPCourse subclass named show_course_id that prints the ID number of the course: #12345
* Create an object of the OOPCourse subclass called course_1 and call the following methods
   * contact_details()
   * trainer_details()

Create a file named method_override.py and follow the instructions below:
* Take user inputs that ask for the name, age, hair colour, and eye colour of a person.
* Create an Adult class with the following attributes and method:
   * Attributes: name, age, eye_color, and hair_color
   * A method called can_drive() which prints the name of the person and that they are old enough to drive.
* Create a subclass of the Adult class named Child that has the same attributes, but overrides the can_drive() method to print the person's name and that they are too young to drive.
* Create some logic that determines if the person is 18 or older and create an instance of the Adult class if this is true. Otherwise, create an instance of the Child class. Once the object has been created, call the can_drive() method to print out whether the person is old enough to drive or not.
